# Sales-Analysis-Project
In this project, we used Python Pandas &amp; Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months' worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.  

- Which month sales were best and why? 
- From which city the most orders were placed? 
- What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of purchases? 
- Which products had the most sales? 
- What products are most often sold together? 
- What product sold the most? Why?
